	<b>Access Points List:</b><br><br>
		<b>Status:</b> This column displays the Enabled/Disabled state of an AP. An AP can be disabled if not in use and enabled when needed. Disabling an AP does not delete the configuration, but stops the AP from sending wireless beacons. Enabling the AP creates a wireless network, where computers and other devices can join and communicate with the devices connected to the access point or the devices on the Local Area Network (LAN).<br><br>
		<b>Virtual AP:</b> This column shows the name for the access point configuration.<br><br>
	        <b>SSID:</b> The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is the name of the wireless network serviced by this AP, and is seen by clients in the 802.11 environment when broadcast is enabled for this AP.<br><br>
		<b>Broadcast:</b> This field indicates whether or not SSID is broadcast in the beacon frames transmitted by the AP. If SSID is not broadcast, then wireless devices will not be able to see the network name (SSID). <b>Enabled</b>  indicates that the SSID is to be broadcasted to the public; <b>Disabled</b> indicates that the SSID is not to be broadcasted and a device would have to specify the SSID exactly to connect to this AP.<br><br>
		<b>Profile Name:</b> This field has a brief description of the security, encryption and authentication combination assigned to the AP. A profile does not have to be unique to an AP; rather this grouping of wireless settings can be applied to more than one AP simultaneously.<br><br>
		<b>Active Time:</b> This field indicates if the AP is configured to be functional for only a certain duration during the day: Yes or No.<br><br>
		<b>Start Time:</b> The time of the day when the AP is activated.<br><br>

	<b>Broadcast:</b> This field indicates whether or not SSID is broadcast in the beacon frames transmitted by the AP. If SSID is not broadcast, then wireless devices will not be able to see the network name (SSID). <b>Enabled</b> indicates that the SSID is to be broadcasted to the public; <b>Disabled</b> indicates that the SSID is not to be broadcasted and a device would have to specify the SSID exactly to connect to this AP.<br><br>
	<b>Security:</b> This field displays the type of wireless security (if any) assigned to this profile: OPEN, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA+WPA2.<br><br>
	<b>Encryption:</b> This field displays the encryption type that is assigned to the profile: TKIP, CCMP, TKIP + CCMP.<br><br>
	<b>Authentication:</b> This field displays the client authentication method that is configured in the profile: PSK, RADIUS, PSK + RADIUS.<br><br>

	<b>Profile Name:</b> Enter a unique (alphanumeric) identifier for this wireless profile.<br><br>
	<b>SSID:</b> The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is the name of the wireless network/APs associated with this profile.<br><br>
	<b>Broadcast SSID:</b> Select ON button to broadcast the SSID. Select OFF button to prevent auto-detection of the SSID. In this case clients that want to connect to this AP will need to specify the SSID without detecting the SSID via a scan of the 802.11 environment.<br><br>
	<b>Security:</b> Choose the type of security to be configured in this profile:<br><br>
	<b>OPEN:</b> No security. Any supported wireless client can connect to this AP (subject to AP ACL policy).<br><br>
	<b>WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):</b> Select this to use WEP encryption on the data packets. WEP is not considered to be secure and can be easily broken. Select this only if there are clients which can only support WEP security (i.e. legacy clients).<br><br>
    <b>Note:</b> OPEN and WEP security modes provide weak or no security and makes a user prone to malicious attacks. For strong wireless security please use WPA, WPA2 or WPA+WPA2.<br><br>
	<b>WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):</b> WPA is part of the wireless security standard (802.11i) standardized by the Wi-Fi Alliance and was intended as an intermediate measure to take the place of WEP while 802.11i was being prepared. It supports TKIP or CCMP encryption (default is TKIP) and PSK or RADIUS based authentication.<br><br>
	<b>WPA2:</b> WPA2 is the implementation of security standard specified in final 802.11i. It supports TKIP or CCMP encryption (default is CCMP) and PSK or RADIUS based authentication.<br><br>
	<b>WPA + WPA2:</b> This mode allows both WPA and WPA2 clients to connect simultaneously. When supported by the client, the stronger security method (WPA2) will be used.<br><br>
	<b>Encryption:</b> Select the WPA/WPA2 encryption method to be used: TKIP, CCMP, or both.<br><br>
	<b>Authentication:</b> Select the WPA/WPA2 authentication method to be used: RADIUS, PSK, or PSK + RADIUS.<br><br>
	<b>WPA Password:</b> The Pre-shared key for WPA/WPA2 PSK authentication. The clients also need to be configured with the same passphrase.<br><br>
	Enable Pre-Authentication: Check this box to enable Pre-Authentication for this profile.<br>

	<b>WEP Index and Keys</b>
	Selecting WEP as the Security option for this profile requires selecting the type of authentication and specifying the static WEP key to be used in the computers or devices that wish to access this secured wireless network.<br><br>
	<b>Authentication:</b> Select either Open System or Shared Key scheme.<br><br>
	<b>Encryption:</b> Select the encryption type - 64 WEP or 128 WEP The larger size keys provide stronger encryption, thus making the key more difficult to crack (i.e. 64 WEP has a 40 bit key which is less secure than the 128 WEP which has a 104 bit key).<br><br>
	<b>WEP Passphrase:</b> Define a alphanumeric phrase (longer than 8 characters for optimal security) and click generate key to generate 4 unique WEP keys. Select one of the four to use as the static key that devices must have in order to use the wireless network.<br><br>
<b>WEP Key 1-4:</b> If WEP Passphrase is not specified, a key can be entered directly in one of the WEP Key boxes. The length of the key should be 5 ASCII characters (or 10 hex characters) for 64-bit WEP and 13 ASCII characters (or 26 hex characters) for 128-bit WEP.<br><br>

		<b>RTS Threshold:</b> The Request to Send (RTS) threshold is the packet size in
		bytes that requires the AP to check the transmitting frames to determine if 
		RTS/Clear to Send (CTS) handshake is required with the receiving client. Using a

		available bandwidth, therefore reducing the apparent throughput of the network

		<b>Fragmentation Threshold:</b> This is the maximum length of the frame, in bytes,
		beyond which packets must be broken up (fragmented) into two or more frames.
		Collisions occur more often for long frames because while sending them, they occupy the channel for a longer time. The default value is 2346, which effectively
