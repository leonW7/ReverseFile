<p><b>Controller Status </b><br>
<b>WLAN controller Operational Status :</b>This status field

            controller may be configured as enabled, but is operationally
            disabled due to configuration dependencies. If the operational
            status is disabled, the reason will be displayed in the following
            status field.<br>
            The WLAN controller is composed of multiple components, and each
            component in the system must acknowledge an enable or disable of the
            WLAN controller. During a transition the operational status might temporarily show a pending status.<br>
			<br>
			<b>WLAN controller Disable Reason :</b> If the status is disabled, this field appears and one of the following reasons is listed.<br>
			<b>None:</b> The cause for the disabled status is unknown.<br>	
			<b>Administrator disabled:</b> The Enable WLAN controller option on the global configuration page has been cleared.<br>	
			<b>No IP Address:</b> The WLAN interface does not have an IP address.<br>	
			<b>No SSL Files:</b> The Unified Wireless controller communicates
            with the APs it manages by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
            connections. The first time you power on the Unified Wireless
            controller, it automatically generates a server certificate that
            will be used to set up the SSL connections. The SSL certificate and
            key generation can take up to an hour to complete.<br>
			If routing is enabled on the controller, the operational status might be disabled due to one of the following reasons:<br>	
			<b>No Loopback Interface:</b> The controller does not have a loopback interface.<br>	
			<b>Global Routing Disabled:</b> Even if the routing mode is enabled
            on the WLAN controller interface, it must also be enabled globally
            for the operational status to be enabled.<br>

            automatically elected or configured to be the Cluster Controller.
            The Cluster Controller gathers status and statistics about all APs
            and clients in the peer group.<br>

<p><b>WDS Group Status</b><br>
				The Wireless Distribution System (WDS)-Managed AP feature allows you to add managed APs to the cluster using over-the-air WDS links through other managed APs. With WDS, APs may be located outdoors where wired connection to the data network is unavailable, or in remote buildings that are not connected to the main campus with a wired network. <br>The WDS AP group consists of the following managed APs
<br>
<br>Root AP—Acts as a bridge or repeater on the wireless medium and communicates with the controller via the wired link<br>
<br>Satellite AP—Communicates with the controller via a WDS link to the Root AP<br>
<br>The WDS links are secured using WPA2 Personal authentication and AES
encryption.<br>This page displays summary information about configured WDS links. At least one group must be configured for the fields to display. To configure a WDS AP group, use the pages available within the WLAN WDS folder.<br>
<br>The following fields are on this page.<br>
<br>
<b>ID :</b>Unique number that identifies the WDS AP group<br><br>
<b>Configured AP Count :</b>Number of APs configured in this WDS AP group<br><br>
