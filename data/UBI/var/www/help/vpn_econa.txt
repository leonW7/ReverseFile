         <p><b>IPSec Policies List:<br>
                      </b>Both Manual and Auto IPsec policies are configured here. Policy 
				identifiers and source/destination details are required for both 
				types. You can use the VPN wizard to quickly create both Manual 
				or Auto policies. Once the policy is created, you can modify it 
				to meet your tunnel requirements.<br>
				If setting up a Manual policy, only the Phase 2 (Manual Policy) 
				parameters are required to define the encryption and authentication 
				key details. These must be the same as on the remote peer. An Auto 
				IPsec policy uses IKE to to automatically exchange keys between 
				two IPsec hosts. The Phase 1 (IKE) and Phase 2 (Auto Policy) details 
				will determine the security of the tunnel. <br>
				The IPsec policy can be in Tunnel or Transport mode. Choose tunnel 
				mode to pass traffic between two trusted networks through an untrusted 
				network. Transport mode (the default) is used for end-to-end communication.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Status:</b> The status of the policy can be enabled (i.e. in 
				use) or disabled (configured but not in use).<br>
				<br>
				<b>Name:</b> A unique name assigned to the policy. The name is not 
				used to identify the tunnel to the remote Wan/client, but for managing 
				the tunnel properties. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Type:</b> The IPsec policy type can be Manual or Auto <br>
				<br>
				<b>IPSec Mode:</b> The IPsec mode can be Tunnel or Transport. IPsec 
				tunnel mode is useful for protecting traffic between different networks, 
				when traffic must pass through an intermediate, untrusted network. 
				Tunnel mode is primarily used for interoperability with gateways, 
				or end-systems that do not support L2TP/IPsec or PPTP connections. 
				Transport mode is the default mode for IPsec, and it is used for 
				end-to-end communications (for example, for communications between 
				a client and a server).<br>
				<br>
				<b>Local:</b> The IP address or address range on the LAN that is 
				covered by this policy. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Remote:</b> The IP address or address range on the remote network 
				that is covered by this policy. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Auth:</b> Authentication Header displays the data integrity algorithm 
				used by the tunnel. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Encr:</b> Encapsulating Security Payload displays the encryption 
				algorithm used by this tunnel.<br>
				<br>
				The actions that can be taken on IPSec Policies are: <br>
				<br>
                                <b>Select All :</b> Selects all the IPSec Policies in the table. <br>

                                <b>IPSec Policy Configuration</b> <br>
				General</b><br>
				<br>
				These settings are required for both Manual and Auto policies.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Policy Name:</b> Enter a unique name to identify the policy.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Policy Type:</b> Select one of the following options: <br>
				<br>
				<b>Manual policy:</b> All settings (including the keys) for the 
				VPN tunnel are manually input for each end point. No third-party 
				server or organization is involved.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Auto Policy:</b> Some parameters for the VPN tunnel are generated 
				automatically. This requires using the IKE (Internet Key Exchange) 
				protocol to perform negotiations between the two VPN Endpoints.<br>
               <br>
				<b>IP Protocol Version:</b> Select the Internet Protocol version to be used (IPv4/IPv6).
				<br>
                <br>
				<b>IKE Version:</b> Select the IKE version to be used.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>IPSec Mode:</b> This can be either Tunnel mode or Transport mode.<br>
				<b><br>
				Transport Mode:</b> This mode can be used when we want to secure 
				communication only between two gateways (The communication between 
				only those 2 gateways is secured and you cannot specify subnet/range 
				etc. options for this mode.)<br>
				<b><br>
				Tunnel Mode:</b> This mode is to be used if you require IPsec communication 
				to happen not just between 2 gateways, but also LAN hosts of the 
				gateways (you can specify subnet, range etc. for this option.)<br>
				<br>
				<b>Select Local Gateway:</b> In the event two WAN ports are configured 
				to connect to an ISP, select the gateway that will be used as the 
				local endpoint for this IPsec tunnel. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Remote Endpoint:</b> Select the type of identifier that you want 
				to provide for the gateway at the remote endpoint: IP Address or 
				FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) <br>
                <br>
                <b>Enable Mode Config:</b> Enables Mode Config feature. Mode Config is
                similar to DHCP and is used to assign IP addresses to remote VPN clients,  
                like iPhone VPN Client. <br>
                <br>
				<b>Enable NetBIOS:</b> Enable this to allow NetBIOS broadcasts 
				to travel over the VPN tunnel, or uncheck this box to disable NetBIOS 
				broadcasts over the VPN tunnel. For client policies, the NetBIOS 
				feature is available by default. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Enable RollOver</b>: Enable this to allow the VPN to rollover 
                when WAN Mode is set to Auto Rollover on the WAN Mode page. <br>
                <br>
				<b>Enable DHCP:</b> Enable this to allow VPN clients to connect 
				to your router over IPsec and get an assigned IP using DHCP.<br>
				<br>
				Tunnel mode IPsec policies require local and remote traffic selection 
				to be defined. For both local and remote endpoints configure the 
				following settings:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Local/Remote IP:</b> Select the type of identifier that you want 
				to provide for the endpoint: <br>
				<br>
				<b>Any:</b> Specifies that the policy is for traffic from the given 
				end point (local or remote). Note that selecting Any for both local 
				and remote end points is not valid. <br>
				<b><br>
				Single:</b> Limits the policy to one host. Enter the IP address 
				of the host that will be part of the VPN in Start IP Address field.<br>
				<b><br>
				Range:</b> Allows computers within an IP address range to connect 
				to the VPN. Enter the Start IP Address and End IP Address in the 
				provided fields.<br>
				<b><br>
				Subnet:</b> Allows an entire subnet to connect to the VPN. Enter 
				the network address in the Start IP Address field, and enter the 
				Subnet Mask in the Subnet Mask field. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Start Address:</b> Enter the first IP address in the range. If 
				you selected Single, simply enter the single IP address in this 
				field and leave the End IP Address field blank.<br>
				<b><br>
				End Address:</b> Enter the last IP address in the range.<br>
				<b><br>
				Subnet Mask:</b> If you chose Subnet as the type, enter the Subnet 
				Mask of the network.<br>
                <br>
                Note: Please make sure that you avoid using overlapping 
                subnets for remote or local traffic selectors. Using these subnets would
                require adding static routes on the router and the hosts to be used.
                Example of one such combination to avoid:
                
                Local Traffic Selector - 192.168.75.0/24
                Remote Traffic Selector - 192.168.0.0./16.<br>
                <br>
				<b>Prefix Length:</b> If you chose Subnet as the type and Protocol as IPv6, enter the Prefix Length of the network.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Enable Keepalive:</b> It periodically sends ping packets to the host on the peer side of the network to keep the tunnel alive. Check the option to enable Keepalive.<br>
                <br>
				<b>Source IP Address:</b> Enter the IP Address from which ping packet needs to be sent.<br>
                <br>
				<b>Destination IP Address:</b> Enter the IP Address to which ping packet needs to be sent.<br>
                <br>
				<b>Detection Period:</b> Router sends ping packets periodically at regular intervals of time which is specified by the user.<br>
                <br>
				<b>Reconnect After Failure Count:</b> Fresh negotiation starts when no acknowledgement is received for the specified number of consecutive packets.<br>
                <br>
				<b>Phase 1 - IKE SA Parameters</b><br>
				<br>
				These settings are applicable for Auto IPsec policies that use IKE 
				to perform negotiations between the two VPN Endpoints. <br>
				Exchange Mode: Choose one of the following options:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Main mode:</b> This mode negotiates the tunnel with higher security, 
				but is slower.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Aggressive mode:</b> This mode establishes a faster connection 
				but with lowered security.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Direction/Type:</b> Choose one of the following connection methods:
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Initiator:</b> The router will initiate the connection to the 
				remote end.<br>
				<b><br>
				Responder:</b> The router will wait passively and respond to remote 
				IKE requests.<br>
				<b><br>
				Both:</b> The router will work in either Initiator or Responder 
				mode.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Nat Traversal:</b> Set NAT traversal to On, if you expect any 
				Network Address Translation (NAT) to occur during IPsec communication. 
				If not set this option to Off.<br>
				<br>
				<b>NAT Keep Alive Frequency (in seconds):</b> When NAT traversal 
				is set to On, use this option to control the keep-alive-frequency 
				value. Keep-alive packets are sent at the mentioned time interval 
				and these are used to keep the NAT mappings alive on the NAT device. 
				Setting this value to 0 disables this feature.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Local Identifier Type:</b> Choose the ISAKMP identifier for this 
				router. It can be one of the following:<br>
				Local WAN IP<br>
				Internet Address/FQDN<br>
				User FQDN<br>
				DER ASN1 DN<br>
				<br>
				<b>Local Identifier:</b> Enter the value of the respective option 
				chosen in the Identifier Type drop-down list. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Remote Identifier Type:</b> The ISAKMP identifier for the remote 
				device. It can be one of the following:<br>
				Remote WAN IP<br>
				Internet Address/FQDN<br>
				User FQDN<br>
				DER ASN1 DN<br>
				<br>
				<b>Remote Identifier:</b> The value of the respective option chosen 
				in the Identifier Type drop down list for the remote host. <br>
				<br>
				Note: If either the Local or Remote identifier type is not an IP 
				address, then negotiation is only possible in Aggressive Mode. If 
				FQDN, User FQDN or DER ASN1 DN is selected, the router will disable 
				Main mode and set the default to Aggressive mode.<br>
				<br>
				The Security Association (SA) parameters define the strength and 
				the mode for negotiating the SA. The fields in the SA are: <br>
				<b>Encryption Algorithm:</b> The algorithm used to negotiate the 
				SA. There are five algorithms supported by this router: DES, 3DES, 
				AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Authentication Algorithm:</b> Specify the authentication algorithm 
				for the VPN header. There are five algorithms supported by this 
				router: MD5, SHA-1, SHA2-256, SHA2-384 and SHA2-512. <br>
				<br>
				Note: Ensure that the authentication algorithm is configured identically 
				on both sides. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Authentication Method:</b> Select Pre-Shared Key for a simple 
				password based key. Selecting RSA-Signature will disable the pre-shared 
				key text box and uses the Active Self Certificate uploaded in the 
				Certificates page. In that case, a certificate must be configured 
				in order for RSA-Signature to work. <br>
				<br>
				Please Note: Following character is not supported for pre-shared 
				key: &quot; (Double Quote character).<br>
				<b><br>
				Pre-Shared Key:</b> alpha-numeric key to be shared with IKE peer<br>
				<br>
				<b>Diffie-Hellman (DH) Group:</b> The Diffie-Hellman algorithm is 
				used when exchanging keys. The DH Group sets the strength of the 
				algorithm in bits.<br>
				<br>
				Note: Ensure that the DH Group is configured identically on both 
				sides of the IKE policy.<br>
				<br>
				<b>SA-Lifetime (sec):</b> the interval after which the Security 
				Association becomes invalid.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Enable Dead Peer Detection:</b> Dead Peer Detection is used to 
				detect whether the Peer is alive or not. If peer is detected as 
				Dead, it deletes the IPsec and IKE Security Association.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Detection Period (sec):</b> Detection Period is the interval 
				between consecutive DPD R-U-THERE messages. DPD R-U-THERE messages 
				are sent only when the IPsec traffic is idle.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Reconnect after failure count:</b> Maximum number of DPD failures 
				allowed before tearing down the connection.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Extended Authentication:</b> Ticking this check-box enables 
				Extended Authentication (XAUTH). Rather than configuring a unique 
				VPN policy for each user, you can enable the VPN gateway router 
				to authenticate users from a stored list of user accounts or with 
				an external authentication server such as a RADIUS server. When 
				connecting many VPN clients to a VPN gateway router, XAUTH allows 
				authentication of users with methods in addition to the authentication 
				method mentioned in the IKE SA parameters.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Username:</b> This is the unique identifier for the user, and 
				can contain any alphanumeric characters.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Password:</b> The password can contain alphanumeric characters.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Phase2-(Manual Policy Parameters)</b> <br>
				<br>
				This section is used when a Manual IPsec policy is in use. The Manual 
				Policy creates an SA (Security Association) based on the following 
				static inputs:<br>
				<br>
				<b>SPI-Incoming, SPI-Outgoing:</b> Enter a hexadecimal value between 
				3 and 8 characters. For example: 0x1234 <br>
				<br>
				<b>Encryption Algorithm:</b> Select the algorithm used to encrypt 
				the data. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Key Length:</b> BLOWFISH and CAST128 are variable length algorithms, 
				and so the key length field is required when using either of these 
				encryption types. For BLOWFISH, the Key Length must be between 40 
				and 448 and it must be a multiple of 8. For CAST128, the Key Length 
				must be between 40 and 128 and it must be a multiple of 8.<br>
				<b><br>
				Key-In:</b> Enter the encryption key of the inbound policy. The 
				length of the key depends on the algorithm chosen: <br>
				<br>
				 DES - 8 characters <br>
				 3DES - 24 characters <br>
				 AES-128 - 16 characters <br>
				 AES-192 - 24 characters <br>
				 AES-256 - 32 characters<br>
				 AES-CCM - 16 characters <br>
				 AES-GCM - 20 characters<br>
				 TWOFISH (128) - 16 characters<br>
				 TWOFISH (192) - 24 characters<br>
				 TWOFISH (256) - 32 characters<br>
				 BLOWFISH and CAST128 are variable length algorithms<br>
				<br>
				<b>Key-Out:</b> Enter the encryption key of the outbound policy. 
				The length of the key depends on the algorithm chosen, as shown 
				above. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Integrity Algorithm:</b> Select the algorithm used to verify 
				the integrity of the data. <br>				
				<b>Key-In:</b> Enter the integrity key (for ESP with Integrity-mode) 
				for the inbound policy. The length of the key depends on the algorithm 
				chosen: 
				<br>
				 MD5 - 16 characters <br>
				 SHA-1 - 20 characters <br>
				 SHA2-224 - 28 characters<br>
				 SHA2-256 - 32 characters <br>
				 SHA2-384 - 48 characters <br>
				 SHA2-512 - 64 characters <br>		
				<b><br>Key-Out:</b> Enter the integrity key (for ESP with Integrity-mode) 
				for the outbound policy. The length of the key depends on the algorithm 
				chosen, as shown above.<br>
				<br>

				<b>Phase2-(Auto Policy Parameters)</b><br>
				When an Auto IPsec policy is used, the phase 2 negotiations require 
				the following parameters. Note that this should match the phase 
				2 settings on the remote tunnel endpoint. <br>
				<br>
				<b>SA Lifetime:</b> Enter the duration of the Security Association 
				and choose the unit from the drop-down list:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Seconds:</b> Choose this option to measure the SA Lifetime in 
				seconds. After the specified number of seconds passes, the Security 
				Association is renegotiated. The default value is 3600 seconds. 
				The minimum value is 300 seconds.<br>
				<b><br>
				Kbytes:</b> Choose this option to measure the SA Lifetime in kilobytes. 
				After the specified number of kilobytes of data is transferred, 
				the SA is renegotiated. The minimum value is 1920000 KB.<br>
				<br>
				Note: When configuring a Lifetime in kilobytes (also known as lifebytes), 
				be aware that two SAs are created for each policy. One SA applies 
				to inbound traffic, and one SA applies to outbound traffic. Due 
				to differences in the upstream and downstream traffic flows, the 
				SA may expire asymmetrically. For example, if the downstream traffic 
				is very high, the lifebyte for a download stream may expire frequently. 
				The lifebyte of the upload stream may not expire as frequently. 
				It is recommended that the values be reasonably set, to reduce the 
				difference in expiry frequencies of the SAs; otherwise the system 
				may eventually run out of resources as a result of this asymmetry. 
				The lifebyte specifications are generally recommended for advanced 
				users only. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Encryption Algorithm:</b> Select the algorithm used to encrypt 
				the data. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Integrity Algorithm:</b> Select the algorithm used to verify 
				the integrity of the data. <br>
				<br>
				<b>PFS Key Group:</b> Check this box to enable Perfect Forward Secrecy 
				(PFS) to improve security. While slower, this protocol helps to 
				prevent eavesdroppers by ensuring that a Diffie-Hellman exchange 
                is performed for every phase-2 negotiation. <br>
                <p><b>Redundant VPN Gateway Parameters</b></p>
                <p><b>Enable Redundant Gateway:</b>To enable Redundant VPN Gateway click the Enable button.
                If you enable Redundant VPN then you need to choose backup tunnel from the drop down list.
                When primary tunnel is down backup tunnel will be up. <br>
                <b>Select Back- up Policy:</b>Choose a policy as a backup of this policy. This lists only those policies
                 which can be configured as backup policies. A backup policy
                 should meet the following conditions.<br>
                1) The Type of the Policy should be Auto <br>
                2) The DPD of the policy should be enable. <br>
                3) The Direction of the policy should be either initiator or both. <br>
                4) The XAuth configuration of the policy should be NONE or Edge Device. <br>
                5) The policy should be Gateway only not client.<br><br>
                <b>Failback time to switch from back-up to primary:</b>
                Enter the time in seconds to confirm that primary tunnel is up and running from failure,
                when the backup policy is active. If the primary tunnel is up for the specified number of seconds,
