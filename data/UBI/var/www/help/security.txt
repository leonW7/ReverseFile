				<b>Web Proxy:</b> A proxy server (or simply, proxy) allows computers 
				to route connections to other computers through the proxy, thus 
				circumventing certain firewall rules. For example, if connections 
				to a specific IP address are blocked by a firewall rule, the requests 
				can be routed through a proxy that is not blocked by the rule, rendering 
				the restriction ineffective. Enabling this feature blocks proxy 
				servers.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Java:</b> Blocks java applets from being downloaded from pages 
				that contain them. Java applets are small programs embedded in web 
				pages that enable dynamic functionality of the page. A malicious 
				applet can be used to compromise or infect computers. Enabling this 
				setting blocks Java applets from being downloaded.<br>
				<br>
				<b>ActiveX:</b> Similar to Java applets, ActiveX controls are installed 
				on a Windows computer while running Internet Explorer. A malicious 
				ActiveX control can be used to compromise or infect computers. Enabling 
				this setting blocks ActiveX applets from being downloaded.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Browser Cookies:</b> Cookies are used to store session information by 
				websites that usually require login. However, several websites use 
				cookies to store tracking information and browsing habits. Enabling this option filters 
				out cookies from being created by a website.<br>

				<b>Note:</b> Many websites require that cookies be accepted in order

                <p><b>Default Outbound Policy for IPv4:</b> <br>
				This configuration field determines whether LAN or DMZ users can 
				access the internet in the absence of specific allowed outbound rules. 
				To permit any outbound traffic to pass through the firewall and 
				reach the WAN, use <b>Allow Always</b> as the default outbound policy.
				<br>
				<br>
				In order to closely manage the outbound traffic use <b>Block Always</b> 
				as the default outbound policy. In this case the router admin will 
				need to configure firewall and application rules in order to permit 
				outbound traffic from LAN and DMZ addresses. <br>
				<br></p>
				<p ><b>Firewall Rules:</b> Inbound rules govern access from the WAN to the LAN or DMZ. Using firewall rules allow you to specify which local resources can be accessed from the internet. By default all access from the internet blocked from accessing the secure LAN, except in response to requests from the LAN or DMZ. Outbound (LAN/DMZ to WAN) rules restrict access to traffic leaving your network, selectively allowing only specific local users to access outside resources. Firewall rules are applied in the order listed. As a general rule, you should move the strictest rules (those with the most specific services or addresses) to the top of the list.  <br>
                <br>
				<b>IPv4 Firewall Rules List:</b><br>
				The List of Available Firewall Rules table includes all firewall 
				rules for this device and allows several operations on the firewall 
				rules. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Status:</b> The status of the rule can be Enabled (active) or 
				Disabled (configured but not in use).<br>
				<br>
				<b>From Zone:</b> The source of the traffic that is controlled by 
				this firewall rule: LAN, VLAN, WAN or DMZ.<br>
				<br>
				<b>To Zone:</b> The destination of the traffic that is controlled 
				by this firewall rule: Secure, Secure(VLAN) or Public.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Service:</b> The service that is controlled by this firewall 
				rule. The name usually indicates the type of traffic the rule covers 
				such as FTP, SSH, telnet, ping, etc. Services not already in the 
				list can be added as a Custom Service.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Action:</b> The action to be taken on the enabled rule:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Block Always:</b> Block selected service at all times.<br>
				<b>Enable Always:</b> Allow data matching the selected service to 
				pass through at all times. <br>
				<b>Block by schedule, otherwise allow:</b> Works in conjunction 
				with a predefined schedule. The selected service will be blocked 
				during the schedule interval and will be allowed to pass through 
				at other times. <br>
				<b>Allow by schedule, otherwise block:</b> Works in conjunction 
				with a predefined schedule. The selected service will be allowed 
				to pass through during the schedule interval and will be blocked 
				at other times. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Source Hosts:</b> The hosts that originate the traffic for this 
				firewall rule: Any, Single, Range.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Destination Hosts:</b> The hosts that receive the traffic for 
				this firewall rule: Any, Single, Range.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Local Server:</b> An IP address and port number of a machine 
				on the secure zone(LAN) which is hosting the server. It is displayed 
				in the form: &lt;IP address:port number&gt;. <br>
				<br>
				For example, if a machine with an IP address of 192.168.1.100 on 
				the LAN side is running a telnet server on port 2000, then the table 
				will display 192.168.10.100:2000. If the telnet server is running 
				on the default port (port 23), then the table will display only 
				the IP address.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Internet Destination:</b> The WAN port that is the destination 
				for the traffic.<br>
				<br>
				The actions that can be taken on firewall rules are: <br>
				<br>
				<b>(Check Box At First Column Header):</b> Selects all the firewall

				<br>
				<b>Available VLANs:</b> Select VLAN name from the list of available VLANs
				if From Zone is selected as SECURE (VLAN).
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>To Zone:</b> Set the destination for traffic that is controlled 
				by this rule: Insecure, Secure (VLAN) or Public.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Available VLANs:</b> Select VLAN name from the list of available VLANs
				if To Zone is selected as SECURE (VLAN). If From Zone is chosen as SECURE (VLAN)  
				then VLAN selected there will not be displayed in this drop&#45;down list<br>
				<br>
				<b>Service:</b> Choose the type of service that is controlled by 
				this firewall rule. Common services are included in the drop&#45;down 
				list. You can add additional services on the Firewall &gt; Services 
				page.<br>
				<br>
<b>Note:</b> While configuring firewall rules for TFTP, H.323 or SIP, please make sure that the corresponding ALG is also turned on. This is required to facilitate the data traffic which will follow the initial control connection negotiation.<br><br>
				<b>Action:</b> Choose the action to be taken:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Block Always:</b> Block the selected service at all times.
				<br>
				<b>Enable Always:</b> Allow the selected service to pass through

				<br>
				<b>Select Schedule:</b> Choose a predefined schedule from the drop&#45;down 
				list. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Source Hosts:</b> Select one of the following:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Any:</b> Choose this option for a rule that applies to traffic 
				from all hosts.<br>
				<b>Single Address:</b> Choose this option for a rule that applies 
				to traffic from one host. Enter the IP address of the host in the
				<b>From</b> box.<br>
				<b>Address Range:</b> Choose this option for a rule that applies 
				to traffic from a group of computers/devices within an IP address 
				range. To specify the range, enter the first address in the <b>From</b> 
				box, and enter the final address in the <b>To</b> box.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Destination Hosts:</b> Select one of the following:<br>
				<b>Any:</b> Choose this option for a rule that applies to traffic 
				destined for all hosts.<br>
				<b>Single Address:</b> Choose this option for a rule that applies 
				to traffic destined for one host. Enter the IP address of the host 
				in the <b>From</b> box.<br>
				<b>Address Range:</b> Choose this option for a rule that applies 
				to traffic destined for a group of computers/devices within an IP 
				address range. To specify the range, enter the first address in 
				the <b>From</b> box, and enter the final address in the <b>To</b> 
				box.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Log:</b> Specify whether or not the packets for this rule should 
				be logged. To log details for all packets that match this rule, 
				select Always. Select Never to disable logging.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				For example, if an outbound rule for a schedule is selected as Block 
				Always, then for every packet that tries to make an outbound connection 
				for that service, a message with the packet&#39;s source address and 
				destination address (and other information) will be recorded in 
				the log. Enabling logging may generate a significant volume of log 
				messages and is recommended for debugging purposes only.<br>
				<br>
				<b>QoS Priority:</b> Assign a priority to IP packets of this service. 
				The priorities are defined by &quot;Type of Service (TOS) in the Internet 
				Protocol Suite&quot; standards, RFC 1349. The gateway marks the Type 
				Of Service (TOS) field as defined below:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Normal&#45;Service:</b> No special priority is given to the traffic. 
				The IP packets for services with this priority are marked with a 
				TOS value of 0. <br>
				<b>Minimize&#45;Cost:</b> Choose this option when data must be transferred 
				over a link that has a lower &quot;cost&quot;. The IP packets for services 
				with this priority are marked with a TOS value of 2. <br>
				<b>Maximize&#45;Reliability:</b> Choose this option when data needs 
				to travel to the destination over a reliable link and with little 
				or no retransmission. The IP packets for services with this priority 
				are marked with a TOS value of 4. <br>
				<b>Maximize&#45;Throughput:</b> Choose this option when the volume of 
				data transferred during an interval is important even if the latency 
				over the link is high. The IP packets for services with this priority 
				are marked with a TOS value of 8. <br>
				<b>Minimize&#45;Delay:</b> Choose this option when the time required 
				(latency) for the packet to reach the destination must be low. The 
				IP packets for services with this priority are marked with a TOS 
				value of 16.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Source NAT Settings</b><br>
				<br>
				These settings are available when the rule manages traffic being 
				allowed from the LAN / DMZ to the WAN. Source Network Address Translation 
				(SNAT) requires rewriting the source or destination IP address of 
				incoming IP packets as they pass through the firewall. <br>
				<b>Note:</b>Source Nat Settings options will be configurable if at
                least one WAN is in NAT Routing Mode independent of the WAN Mode
                configured.<br>
				<br>
				<b>External IP Address:</b> You can use choose WAN interface address 
				or choose Single Address. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Single IP Address:</b> If Single Address was selected for the 
				External IP address, define it here.<br>
				<br>
				<b>WAN Interface:</b> Choose one of the available configured WAN 
				interfaces if the SNAT is to be done on all matching traffic coming 
				from that interface.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Destination NAT Settings</b><br>
				These settings are required when the traffic is coming from the 
				WAN to the DMZ or the LAN. Destination Network Address Translation 
				maps a public IP address (your WAN1 address, WAN2
				address, or another address) to an IP address on your private network.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Internal IP Address:</b> Specify an IP address of a machine on 
				the Local Network which is hosting the server. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Enable Port Forwarding:</b> Check this box to enable port forwarding 
				to the port that you specify in the Translate Port Number field.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Translate Port Number:</b> Enter the port number to use for port 
				forwarding. For example, if a machine on the Local Network side 
				is running a telnet server on port 2000, then check the Enable Port 
				Forwarding box and type 2000 in the Translate Port Number field. 
				If the server is listening on the default port 23, then the box 
				can be left unchecked.<br>
				<br>
				<b>External IP Address:</b> Select the internet destination IP address 
				that is used for this firewall rule: WAN1, WAN2, 
				or Other. If you choose Other, enter the IP address in the Other 
				IP Address field.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Other IP Address:</b> Enter the WAN IP address that will map 
				to the internal server. <br>

				to traffic from a group of computers/devices within an IP address 
				range. To specify the range, enter the first address in the <b>From</b> 
				box, and enter the final address in the <b>To</b> box.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Destination Hosts:</b> Select one of the following:<br>
				<b>Any:</b> Choose this option for a rule that applies to traffic 
				destined for all hosts.<br>
				<b>Single Address:</b> Choose this option for a rule that applies 
				to traffic destined for one host. Enter the IP address of the host 
				in the <b>From</b> box.<br>
				<b>Address Range:</b> Choose this option for a rule that applies 
				to traffic destined for a group of computers/devices within an IP 
				address range. To specify the range, enter the first address in 
				the <b>From</b> box, and enter the final address in the <b>To</b> 
				box.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Log:</b> Specify whether or not the packets for this rule should 
				be logged. To log details for all packets that match this rule, 
				select Always. Select Never to disable logging.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				For example, if an outbound rule for a schedule is selected as Block 
				Always, then for every packet that tries to make an outbound connection 
				for that service, a message with the packet&#39;s source address and 
				destination address (and other information) will be recorded in 
				the log. Enabling logging may generate a significant volume of log 
				messages and is recommended for debugging purposes only.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Source NAT Settings</b><br>
				<br>
				These settings are available when the rule manages traffic being 
				allowed from the LAN / DMZ to the WAN. Source Network Address Translation 
				(SNAT) requires rewriting the source or destination IP address of 
				incoming IP packets as they pass through the firewall. <br>
				<br>
				<b>External IP Address:</b> You can use choose WAN interface address 
				or choose Single Address. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Single IP Address:</b> If Single Address was selected for the 
				External IP address, define it here.<br>
				<br>
				<b>WAN Interface:</b> Choose one of the available configured WAN 
				interfaces if the SNAT is to be done on all matching traffic coming 
				from that interface.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Destination NAT Settings</b><br>
				These settings are required when the traffic is coming from the 
				WAN to the DMZ or the LAN. Destination Network Address Translation 
				maps a public IP address (your WAN1 address, WAN2
				address, or another address) to an IP address on your private network.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Internal IP Address:</b> Specify an IP address of a machine on 
				the Local Network which is hosting the server. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Enable Port Forwarding:</b> Check this box to enable port forwarding 
				to the port that you specify in the Translate Port Number field.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Translate Port Number:</b> Enter the port number to use for port 
				forwarding. For example, if a machine on the Local Network side 
				is running a telnet server on port 2000, then check the Enable Port 
				Forwarding box and type 2000 in the Translate Port Number field. 
				If the server is listening on the default port 23, then the box 
				can be left unchecked.<br>
				<br>
				<b>External IP Address:</b> Select the internet destination IP address 
				that is used for this firewall rule: WAN1, WAN2, 
				or Other. If you choose Other, enter the IP address in the Other 
				IP Address field.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Other IP Address:</b> Enter the WAN IP address that will map

:|algs|:
                <p ><b>ALGs:</b> ALGs are security component that enhance the firewall and NAT support of this router to seamlessly support application layer protocols. Because the ALG understands the protocol used by the specific application that it supports, it is a very secure and efficient way of introducing support for client applications through the router's firewall. <br>
                <br>
				<b>Enable ALGs</b><br>
				This router supports kernel level ALGs for the following protocols:<br>
				<br>
				Check with the system administrator of your corporate network whether 
				your VPN client supports NAT traversal. Note that L2TP VPN connections 
				typically use IPsec to secure the connection. To achieve multiple 
				VPN pass&#45;through in this case, the IPsec ALG must be enabled.<br>
				<br>
				<b>RTSP:</b> Allows applications that use Real Time Streaming Protocol 
				to receive streaming media from the internet. QuickTime and Real 
				Player are some of the common applications using this protocol.<br>
				<br>
				<b>SIP:</b> Allows devices and applications using VoIP (Voice over 
				IP) to communicate across NAT. Some VoIP applications and devices 
				have the ability to discover NAT devices and work around them. This 
				ALG may interfere with the operation of such devices. If you are 
				having trouble making VoIP calls, try turning this ALG off.<br>
				<br>
				<b>H.323:</b> Allows H.323 (specifically Microsoft Netmeeting) clients 
				to communicate across NAT. Note that if you want your buddies to 
				call you, you should also set up a virtual server for NetMeeting.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>TFTP:</b> Allows Trivial FTP (TFTP) clients and servers to transfer 
				data across NAT<br>

                <p><b>Application Rules:</b> <br>
				Application rules are also commonly referred to as port triggering 
				rules. Port triggering allows computers on the private network (LAN 
				or DMZ) to request one or more ports to be forwarded to them. Unlike 
				basic port forwarding, which forwards ports to only one IP address, 
				port triggering waits for an outbound request from the private network 
				on one of the defined outgoing ports. It then automatically sets 
				up forwarding to the IP address from where the request was made. 
				When the application ceases to transmit data over the port, the 
				router waits for a timeout interval and then closes the port or 
				range of ports, making them available to other computers on the 
				private network. <br>
				For example, if an IRC client on the private network makes a connection 
				request through port 6667 and sends its username information to 
				the IRC server, the IRC server will send an IDENT verification packet 
				on port 113 to check the authenticity of the IRC client. In NAT 
				mode, the router will discard this packet since it doesn&#39;t know 
				which computer to send the request on port 113 to. A Port Triggering 
				rule can define port 6667 (or the range: 6660 to 7000) as the outgoing 
				(trigger) port(s) and port 113 as the incoming (response) port.<br>

                from the WAN interfaces. Ping is often used by malicious
                Internet users to locate active networks or PCs. <br> 
                <br>
				<b>WAN Security Checks</b><br>
				<br>
				<b>Enable Stealth Mode:</b> If Stealth Mode is enabled, the router 
				will not respond to port scans from the WAN. This makes it less 
				susceptible to discovery and attacks.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Block TCP Flood:</b> If this option is enabled, the router will 
				drop all invalid TCP packets and be protected from a SYN flood attack.<br>
				<br>
                <b>TCP Filter Check</b><br>
                <b>Filter Check:</b> If this option is enabled, then router will drop invalid TCP packets(FIN,RST and ACK) going with SNAT while the connection is closed. Some of the other packets like TCP OUT-OF-WINDOW are also considered to be invalid. Disable this option while taking performance in Ixia setup as enabling this option will effect the throughput. <br><br>
				<b>LAN Security Checks</b><br>
				<b>Block UDP Flood:</b>If this option is enabled, the router will 
				not accept more than the configured value in 'UDP Connection Limit' which indicates 
                                simultaneous, active UDP connections from a single computer on the LAN. <br>

		                <br>
				<b>ICSA Settings</b><br>
				<b>Block ICMP Notification:</b> selecting this prevents ICMP packets

				be captured and used in a Ping (ICMP) flood DoS attack. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Block Fragmented Packets:</b> selecting this option drops any 
				fragmented packets through or to the gateway.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Block Multicast Packets:</b> selecting this option drops multicast 
				packets, which could indicate a spoof attack, through or to the 
				gateway.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Block Spoofed IP Packets:</b> Selecting this option drops
                		spoofed IP packets, which could indicate a spoof attack, through
