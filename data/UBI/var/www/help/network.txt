                <b>LAN Ping</b><br>
				<b>Allow Ping from LAN:</b> If this option is disabled, the
                		ping requests to the LAN interface are blocked.<br>
                		<br>
                <b>IP Address Setup</b><br>
				<b>IP Address:</b> Enter the LAN IP address for the router.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Subnet Mask:</b> Subnet Mask for the above IP Address<br>
				<br>
				<b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you change the LAN IP address of the router, 
				the browser will not respond when you click Save to save the changes. 
				You must use the new IP address to reconnect to the Configuration 
				Utility. For example, if you change the LAN TCP/IP address from 
				192.168.10.1 (default) to 10.0.0.1, you must change the IP address 
				of your computer (or release and renew IP address if connected via 
				DHCP) so that it is in the 10.0.0.0 subnet and then type http://10.0.0.1/ 
				in your browser to connect to the Configuration Utility. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DHCP Set Up</b><br>
				Router will function as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration 
				Protocol) server, when we enable DHCP mode, providing TCP/IP configuration to computers connected 
				to the LAN network. <br>
				<br>
				<b>DHCP Mode:</b> If the computers on the LAN are configured with 
				static IP addresses or are configured to use another DHCP server, 
				select the None option. If DHCP Relay is selected, then enter the 
				relay gateway information. To use the router as a DHCP server, select 
				DHCP Server and enter the following information: <b><br>
				</b><br>

				<b>Starting IP Address:</b> Enter the first IP address in the range. 
				Any new DHCP client joining the LAN will be assigned an IP address 
				between this address and the Ending IP Address. <br>
				<b><br>
				Ending IP Address:</b> Enter the last IP address in the range of 
				addresses to lease to LAN hosts. Any new DHCP client joining the 
				LAN will be assigned an IP address between the Starting IP Address 
				and this IP address.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Note:</b> The Starting and Ending DHCP addresses should be in 
				the same &quot;network&quot; as the LAN TCP/IP address of the router (the 
				IP Address field in LAN TCP/IP Setup section). <br>
				<br>
                <b>Default Gateway: </b> Enter the default gateway for dhcp server mode.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b> Domain Name:</b> Enter domain name for lan configuration. 
                <br><br>
				<b>Primary DNS Server:</b> Enter the primary DNS Server IP. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Secondary DNS Server:</b> Secondary DNS Server IP. <br>
				<br>
				<b>WINS Server:</b> IP address of a WINS server (Optional). The 
				Windows Internet Naming Service is the equivalent of a DNS server 
				but uses the NetBIOS protocol to resolve hostnames. If the network 
				consists only of Windows based computers and you would like to use 
				a WINS server for name resolution, then enter the IP address of 
				the WINS server. The router will include the WINS server IP address 
				in the DHCP configuration when acknowledging a DHCP request from 
				a DHCP client.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Lease Time:</b> Enter the duration (in hours) for which IP addresses 
				will be leased to clients.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Relay Gateway:</b> Enter the gateway address.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DNS Host Name Mapping</b><br>
				DNS Host Name Mapping is used to assign a specific IP address to 
				a domain name. We can use this domain name instead of IP Address
				to access that particular host.<br><br>
				<b>Host Name:</b> Enter a Host Name.<br><br>
				<b>IP Address:</b> Enter the IP Address to be assigned to the 
				Host Name.<br><br>
				<b>LAN Proxy</b><br>
				<b>Enable DNS Proxy:</b> On button enable DNS proxy on this 
				LAN. When this feature is enabled, the router will act as a proxy 
				for all DNS requests and communicate with the ISP's DNS servers 
				(as configured in the WAN settings page). All DHCP clients will 
				receive the Primary/Secondary DNS IP along with the IP where the 
				DNS Proxy is running, i.e. the box's LAN IP. All DHCP clients will 
				receive the DNS IP addresses of the ISP excluding the DNS Proxy 
				IP address when it is disabled. The feature is particularly useful 
				in Auto Rollover mode. For example, if the DNS servers for each 
				connection are different, then a link failure may render the DNS 
				servers inaccessible. However, when the DNS proxy is enabled, then 
				clients can make requests to the router and the router, in turn, 
				sends those requests to the DNS servers of the active connection.

				<p><b>Dynamic Routing (RIP)</b><br>
				RIP (Routing Information Protocol, RFC 2453) is an Interior Gateway 
				Protocol (IGP) that is commonly used in internal networks. It allows 
				a router to exchange its routing information automatically with 
				other routers, and allows it to dynamically adjust its routing tables 
				and adapt to changes in the network.<br>
				<br>
				Note: RIP is disabled by default. <br>
				<br>
				<b>RIP Direction:</b> Determines how the router sends and receives 
				RIP packets: <br>
				<br>
				<b>
				None:</b> The router neither broadcasts its route table nor does 
				it accept any RIP packets from other routers. This effectively disables 
				RIP.<br>
				<br>
                <b>
				In Only:</b> The router accepts RIP information from other routers, 
				but does not broadcast its routing table.<br>
				<br><b>
				Out Only:</b> The router broadcasts its routing table periodically 
				but does not accept RIP information from other routers. <br>
				<b>Both:</b> The router both broadcasts its routing table and also 
				processes RIP information received from other routers. <br>
				<br>
				<b>RIP Version:</b> RIP version can be one of the following<br>
				<br>
				<b>Disabled:</b> select to disable RIP.<br>
				<br>
				<b>RIP-1:</b> this is a class-based routing version that does not 
				include subnet information. This is the most commonly supported 
				version. <br>
				<br>
				<b>&nbsp;RIP-2:</b> includes all the functionality of RIPv1 plus 
				it supports subnet information. Though the data is sent in RIP-2 
				format for both RIP-2B and RIP-2M, the mode in which packets are 
				sent is different. RIP-2B broadcasts data in the entire subnet, 
				while RIP-2M sends data to multicast addresses. RIPng is an extension 
				of RIPv2 to support IPv6. <br>

				in large networks such as ISP backbone and enterprise networks. <br>
				<br>
				<b>Status:</b> This column displays the Enable/Disable state of OSPFv2 for a
				particular interface.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Interface</b>The physical network interface on which OSPFv2 is
				Enabled/Disabled.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Area:</b>The area to which the interface belongs.
				Two routers having a common segment; their interfaces have to belong
				to the same area on that segment. The interfaces should belong to the same subnet
	 		   	and have similar mask.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Priority:</b>Helps to determine the OSPFv2 designated router for a
				network.The router with the highest priority will be more eligible to become
				Designated Router. Setting the value to 0, makes the router ineligible to
				become Designated Router. The default value is 1.Lower value means higher 
				priority.<br>
				<br>
				<b>HelloInterval:</b>The number of seconds for HelloInterval timer value.
				Setting this value, Hello packet will be sent every timer value seconds on the
				specified interface. This value must be the same for all routers attached to a
				common network. The default value is 10 seconds.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DeadInterval:</b>The number of seconds that a device's hello packets must
				not have been seen before its neighbors declare the OSPF router down.This
				value must be the same for all routers attached to a common network.The
				default value is 40 seconds.<br>
				<br>
				OSPF requires these intervals to be exactly the same between two neighbors. If any
				of these intervals are different, these routers will not become neighbors on a
	 		    particular segment<br>
				<br>
				<b>Cost:</b>The cost of sending a packet on an OSPFv2 interface.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Authentication Type:</b>.This column displays the type of authentication to
				be used for OSPFv2.If Authentication type is none the interface does not

                Remarking CoS to DSCP is an advanced QoS configuration, where
                the Layer 2 quality of service field is translated to a Layer 3
                QoS field in the packet, so that upstream routers can make a QoS
                decision based on the DSCP field set in the packet. Remarking is
                only applicable to packets that originate on the LAN and flow
                outside through the Option.<br>

                <p><b>Router Advertisement:<br>
				Router Advertisement Daemon (RADVD)</b><br>
				RADVD listens for router solicitations in the IPv6 LAN and responds 
				with router advertisements as required. This is stateless IPv6 auto 
				configuration as it distributes IPv6 prefixes to all nodes on the 
				network.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Status :</b> You can enable the RADVD process here to allow 
				stateless auto configuration of the IPv6 LAN network.<br>

				<b>Advertise Mode:</b> Select one of the following:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Unsolicited Multicast:</b> select to send router advertisements 
				(RA's) to all interfaces belonging to the multicast group.<br>
				<b><br>
				Unicast Only:</b> This option restricts advertisements to well known 
				IPv6 addresses only (RA's are sent to the interface belonging to 
				the known address only)<br>
				<br>
				<b>Advertise Interval:</b> This sets the maximum advertise interval. 
				The advertise interval used when RADVD is enabled is a random value 
				between Minimum Router Advertisement Interval and Maximum Router 
				Advertisement Interval. The minimum router advertisement interval 
				is 1/3 of this configured value, and the default is 30 seconds.<br>
				<br>
				<b>RA Flags:</b> Chose Managed to use the administered /stateful 
				protocol for address auto configuration. If the Other flag is selected 
				the host uses administered/stateful protocol of other (i.e. non&#45;address) 
				information auto configuration.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Router Preference:</b> Chose between Low/Medium/High for the 
				preference associated with the RADVD process of the router. This 
				feature is useful if there are other RADVD enabled devices on the 
				LAN. The default is high. <br>
				<br>
				<b>MTU:</b> This is used in RA's to ensure all nodes on the network 
				use the same MTU value in the cases where the LAN MTU is not well 
				known. The default is 1500<br>
				<br>
				<b>Router Lifetime:</b> The lifetime in seconds of the route. The
