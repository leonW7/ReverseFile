                to enable NTP server communication. Otherwise use the router's
                RTC and configure the time and time zone manually. Accurate date
                and time on the router is critical for firewall schedules, Wi-Fi
                power saving support to disable APs at certain times of the day,

                <p><b>Power Saving:</b> There are two options available to
                support power efficiency on the router. With Length Detection
                State enabled, the Ethernet cable link length will be detected
                by the router and power to the port will be modified
                accordingly.<br>
                <br>
				<b>By Link Status :</b> When enabled, the total power to the LAN 
				Switch is dependent on the number of connected ports. The overall 
				current draw when a single port is connected is less than when all 
				of the available LAN ports have an active Ethernet connection.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>By Cable Length Detection :</b> When enabled the LAN Switch will reduce 
				the overall current supplied to the LAN port when a small cable 
				length is connected to that port. Longer cables have higher resistance 
				than shorter cables and require more power to transmit packets over 
				that distance. This option will reduce the power to a LAN port if 
				an Ethernet cable of less than 10 ft is detected as being connected 
				to that port. <br>

	<p><b>IPv6 Logs </b><br><br>

	This section is used to configure the logging options for each network segment (for example, LAN-WAN).<br><br>

	<b>Note:</b> Enabling logging options may generate a significant volume of log messages and is recommended for debugging purposes only.<br><br>

	<b>Accepted Packets:</b> This logs packets that were successfully transferred through the segment. This option is useful when the Default Outbound Policy is "Block Always" (see the Firewall Rules page under the Firewall menu).<br><br>

	<b>Example:</b> If Accept Packets from LAN to WAN is enabled and there is a firewall rule to allow SSH traffic from LAN, then whenever a LAN machine tries to make an SSH connection, those packets will be accepted and a message will be logged. (Make sure the log option is set to allow for this firewall rule.)<br><br>

	<b>Dropped Packets:</b> Logs packets that were blocked from being transferred through the segment. This option is useful when the Default Outbound Policy is "Allow Always" (see the Firewall Rules page under the Firewall menu).<br><br>
	<b>Example:</b> If Drop Packets from LAN to WAN is enabled and there is a firewall rule to block SSH traffic from LAN, then whenever a LAN machine tries to make an SSH connection, those packets will be dropped and a message will be logged. (Make sure the log option is set to allow for this firewall rule.)<br><br>
