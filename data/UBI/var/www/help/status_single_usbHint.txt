:|rfScan|:
Through AP RF Scan Status page, you can view information about all APs detected via RF scan, including those reported as Rogues.The radios on each AP can periodically scan the radio frequency to collect information about other APs and wireless clients that are within range. In normal operating mode the AP always scans on the operational channel for the radio.
:|rfScanEnd|:

:|deAuthenticationAttacks|:
The AP De-Authentication Attack Status page contains information about rogue APs that the Cluster Controller has attacked by using the de-authentication attack feature.This feature is disabled by default.The wireless controller can protect against rogue APs by sending de-authentication messages to the rogue AP. The de-authentication attack feature must be globally enabled in order for the wireless system to do this function. Make sure that no legitimate APs are classified as rogues before enabling the attack feature.

:|detectedClientsEnd|:

:|clustering|:
This page provides information about other Unified Wireless Controllers in the network. Peer wireless Controllers within the same cluster exchange data about themselves, their managed APs, and clients. The Controller maintains a database with this data so you can view information about a peer, such  as its IP address and software version. If the Controller loses contact with a peer, all of the data for that peer is deleted.
